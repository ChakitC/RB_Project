# Validation

Use this document for local C# validation. These rules are project policy.

## Canonical Command

Run C# validation only through:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File 'P:\Game_RB_Project\RB_Project\Assets\Scripts\CheckAssemblyBuild.ps1'
```

Do not run `dotnet build` directly against Unity `.csproj` files for gameplay
validation.

## Build Artifact Rule

Do not run any build command that contains either of these paths:

- `Assets\Scripts\_buildbin`
- `Assets\Scripts\_buildobj`

Build artifacts must stay outside `Assets` so Unity does not import generated
assemblies back into the project.

## What The Script Does

`CheckAssemblyBuild.ps1` uses Unity-generated `Assembly-CSharp.csproj` for:

- references
- define symbols
- analyzers
- compiler settings
- project references

It then builds a temporary scanned project outside `Assets`. The scanned
project generates its `Compile` list from real source files under `Assets`.

The source scan is intentionally scoped:

- Include default-assembly `.cs` files under `Assets`.
- Exclude files under folders with `.asmdef`.
- Exclude `Editor` folders.
- Exclude Unity first-pass roots such as `Assets\Plugins`,
  `Assets\Standard Assets`, and `Assets\Pro Standard Assets`.
- Do not include `Packages/**/*.cs` directly.

Package and asmdef code should remain referenced through Unity-generated
project references or assemblies.

## When To Validate

Run the validation command after editing C# source when the change touches:

- gameplay behavior
- public or serialized APIs
- context reference resolution
- stat, passive, weapon, inventory, save, or AI flows
- shared interfaces or data contracts

Markdown-only documentation changes do not require C# validation.

## Failure Handling

If validation fails:

1. Fix source-code errors first.
2. Do not edit generated `.csproj` or `.sln` files unless the task explicitly
   requires it.
3. Do not move new classes into unrelated existing files just because Unity has
   not regenerated project files yet.
4. Keep new Unity classes in their intended `.cs` files.
5. If the generated `.csproj` is stale, refresh Unity/reimport/regenerate project
   files instead of changing file ownership.
# Weapon affix validation

Run **Tools > Weapons > Affixes > Validate (Dry Run)** before builds. The build
preprocessor blocks missing behavior assets, duplicate ids, and invalid roll
ranges. `WeaponAffixFrameworkTests` verifies all 27 registered definitions,
endpoint rolls, structured tooltip data, Last Round eligibility, persistent-state
cloning, typed overkill metadata, and the recursion guard.

On 2026-08-03 the focused EditMode suite passed 6/6 and
`CheckAssemblyBuild.ps1` passed with 0 errors. The full EditMode run was blocked
by the pre-existing `PartySpawnUnityTests` scene-open error for
`Assets/Scenes/Map_Play_Pototype/State_1.unity`.
